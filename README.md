Project SamarthIntelligent Q&A for India's Agricultural & Climate DataProject Samarth is a functional prototype of an intelligent Q&A system that answers complex, natural language questions about India's agricultural economy and its relationship with climate patterns.It's designed to reason across multiple, disparate government datasets in real-time, providing traceable, data-backed insights.(Add a screenshot of your running application here)Core MissionGovernment portals like data.gov.in host thousands of valuable datasets. However, this data exists in varied formats (e.g., annual crop reports vs. daily rainfall data), making cross-domain analysis difficult.Project Samarth solves this by:Integrating disparate data sources into a single, analysis-ready dataset.Understanding natural language questions from a user.Generating & Executing data analysis code on the fly.Synthesizing a clear, citable answer based on the computed data.How It Works: System ArchitectureThis prototype uses a "Generative AI Data Agent" architecture.Phase 1: Data Integration (On Startup)The Python Flask server starts and loads three source CSVs:agri.csv: Annual district-level crop production.rain.csv: Daily district-level rainfall.soil.csv: Daily district-level soil moisture.A Pandas script cleans, aggregates (converts daily climate data to annual averages/totals), and merges these sources into a single master_df (DataFrame) in memory.Phase 2: Intelligent Q&A (On-Demand)1. User Asks: A user types a question (e.g., "What was the total RICE PRODUCTION in Maharashtra in 2010?") into the web UI.2. Code Generation: The question is sent to the Gemini API with a system prompt instructing it to generate Python/Pandas code to answer that question using the master_df.3. Code Execution: The Flask server receives the generated code and executes it (exec()) in a secure context against the master_df.4. Answer Synthesis: The data result from the code (e.g., 21345.87) is sent back to the Gemini API.5. Final Answer: Gemini synthesizes this raw data into a natural language answer (e.g., "The total RICE PRODUCTION in Maharashtra in 2010 was 21,345.87 (1000 tons).") and displays it to the user, providing full traceability.Tech StackBackend: Python, FlaskData Analysis: PandasGenerative AI: Google Gemini APIFrontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScriptSetup & InstallationFollow these steps to run the prototype on your local machine.1. Clone the Repositorygit clone [https://github.com/your-username/project-samarth.git](https://github.com/your-username/project-samarth.git)
cd project-samarth
2. Install DependenciesInstall the required Python libraries.pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Add Data FilesThis prototype does not include the data. You must download the source CSVs and place them in the root directory with the following names:agri.csv (ICRISAT District Level Data)rain.csv (IMD Rainfall Data)soil.csv (IMD Soil Moisture Data)4. Add Your API KeyThe application requires a Google Gemini API key to function.Get your key from Google AI Studio.Open the app.py file.Paste your key into the API_KEY variable on line 16:API_KEY = "PASTE_YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
5. Run the Applicationpython app.py
The server will start, load and process the data files (this may take a moment), and then be available.Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser to use Project Samarth.Security NoteThis prototype uses exec() to run AI-generated code. This is a significant security risk in a production environment. For this demonstration, it is used to prove the "code generation" architecture. A production-grade system would require a heavily sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker container, RestrictedPython) to execute the code safely.
